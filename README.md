### Docker Development
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t slazero-net .

# Run container
docker run -p 8080:80 slazero-net

# View logs
docker logs <container_id>

# Stop container
docker stop <container_id>
```

```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

## 🎪 Advanced Chaos Features

- **Random CSS/JS failures**: Sometimes styles just don't load
- **Custom error page routing**: 404s and 500s get special treatment
- **Chaos headers**: Custom HTTP headers for authenticity
- **Health checks**: That probably fail
